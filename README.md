# Flight Tracking App
With the world starting to open up slowly, many have turned their attention to traveling again. To help with this influx of flights, users need an application to locally store upcoming flights (whether their own or friends and family) so they can track both the schedule and the flight itself. Your job is to build an interface that allows users to:
- Search a flight
- Add a flight
- See the live status of added flights
- Remove a flight

# Technology Requirements
- Uses React
- Uses AirLabs API
- Typescript


You can use any libraries you'd like for this exercise. Focus on reusability a of the components and how we define the props surface. You can use the shell in the program output section to add any dependencies (instead of having to add manually to package.json).
